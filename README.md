# **Team Project - BrickBreaker (Null Pointer Exception)**

### Game Introduction and Plan
We are implementing a  simple brick breaker game which will be having layers of bricks and ball with which to break the layers. The player moves the paddle from left to right to keep the ball from falling. A life is used when the player fails to hit the ball with paddle. The paddle doesn’t bounce the ball like a mirror, although it does so when the ball hits right in the middle. The closer the bounce take place to the left end of the paddle, a more significant left turn is added to an expected mirror bouncing. 

A regular brick disappears when it’s hit by the ball, or breaks a little if it’s a bulkier brick. At the same time, for every brick hit, there will be increase in the score. And by default the player will be given 3 lives. If the user finishes off these 3 lives, then the game will be over. In addition to that, there will be some special bricks in the game. If the player hits those bricks, a new ball will be added into game. When the user hits this new ball with paddle, the paddle size increases. We are also planning to implement background music for our brick breaker game.

### **A High Level Architecture Diagram**

--- First we can come up with the initial idea itself ---

### **A summary of the key features (include any special design ideas implemented)**

--- Insert all the **WORKING** key features that we added and implemented to the game. (Must be credible enough for it to go here) ---
