### **What have I been working on?**

This week I was working on the adding two player mode in the game using strategy design pattern.
Also we change the structure of our project to make it more organized. I changed the buttons on the menu
screen to allow user to choose the game mode - 1 player or 2 players. Also, I refactor some original codes into the one player strategy as the default strategy, so I can add more new strategies or game modes without modifying the original code.

### **What I plan to do today/this week?**

In the next sprint, I will keep working on the 2 player mode of the game. I plan to add a new strategy class to include all the differences parts between 1 player and 2 player mode, including the second racket for player 2, and the moving strategy. Right now, player controll the racket with arrow keys or A and D, the player can switch the move approach by click on the button on the top of screen. After adding the two player mode, that button will be disabled, and player 1 can only controll the racket with arrow keys, player 2 can controll the racket with A and D. To adding a new racket, I will need to change the codes in the **GameBoard** class, also I will change the position of the second racket.

### **What are my blockers?**

I don't have any blockers in this current sprint.

### **Core XP value - (Courage)**

For this week, the courage aspect is quite well defined. Team members was pointing out the the bugs and some places we can improve in our code. Also since it's almost the end of spring semester, some team members, including me, got other projects to work on and have to delay some tasks. I think telling the truth is part of the courage.
