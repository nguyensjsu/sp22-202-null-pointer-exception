### **What have I been working on?**

For the second sprint, I was working on implementing and refactoring the classes that have been assigned to me, including **HighScoreBoard**, **Item**, and **MenuScreen** classes. The **HighScoreBoard** class is for displaying the top scores of the player have ever got by playing this game. For the **Item** class, it extends the **Sprite** class, which is basically a reward item that will drop from above when the player hits the brick that contains the item. The **MenuScreen** class is for displaying the menu sceen of the game, which includes three buttons for now - **Start Game**, **High Scores**, and **Change Theme**. There will be more buttons in the menu screen after we add more features to our game.

### **What I plan to do today/this week?**

For the next sprint, I plan to keep improve the design and structure of the code. Additionally, I will try to implement a new feature that allows two players to coordinate in one game. There will be two paddles on the same screen; one paddle will be slightly above another one. One player will use the arrow keys to controll the paddle, the other one will use key A and D to controll the paddle, so they can coordinate with each other to get a higher score. I plan to use Strategy pattern to implement this feature. The user can choose one player mode or two player mode in the menu screen. And the game will change the game strategy based on what mode the user selected.

### **What are my blockers?**

For the second sprint, I don't have any road blockers.

### **Core XP value - (Courage)**

For the last week, our team forgot to submit the individual journals for week 1, which is clearly a failure and causes some deduction of points for every one of us. But the good thing is, from the courage aspect, none of us are making excuses for the failure. We have the courage to accept and learn from our failures.
