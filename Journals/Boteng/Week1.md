### **What have I been working on?**

For the first sprint, since we decided to build a game, we have had a brainstorm meeting for ideas of what kinds of game we want to build. At the beginning, we were focusing on uniqueness of game to meet the requirements. But when I went through team projects repos from previous students of this class to get some ideas, I found that the project can be a common game with unique features. So we decided to build a game that we are familiar with, which is the Brick Breaker.

I also created the task board on Github for tracking the progress of our project, which can be divided to three categories - Done, To-do, In-progress.

### **What I plan to do today/this week?**

The codes we have right now is highly tight, which can be easily broken by changing a few lines of codes, so for the next sprint, the main objectives for us is to refactoring the codes to make it more extendable, which will make it easier for us to implement new features. I was assigned to implement and refactor the **HighScoreBoard**, **Item**, and **MenuScreen** classes. By refactoring those classes and ensuring the codes follows the desgin patterns we learned, it will be more easier for us to add our own rules and features for the rest of out project.

### **What are my blockers?**

I don't have any blockers right now, everything goes well for the first week.

### **Core XP value - (Courage)**

From my perspective, courage in extreme programming is the braveness to adapt to changes, take responsibilities, and tell the truth abou progress and estimates. For our team, the courage aspect went smoothly through the first sprint. When we discussed about the ideas fo project, all of us can actively point out the defects of other's opinions and take responsibilities for the project.
