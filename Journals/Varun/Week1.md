### **Research and Analysis of game requirements:**
As the requirement is to design a game, I have gone through several discussions with my team and finally shortlisted a game to design as our final project. And our game will be Brick Breaker. Initially, I have referred several videos about brick breaker game to know the base concept of the game. Then I came to know several features that will be included in the game as in Score, Slower mode, Faster mode, Lives of a player. And also came to know that there will be a concept where if the ball misses hitting any bricks,then a life of a player will be lost. So, to design this game, the main modules that we need to implement is the implementation of bricks, implementation of ball, and design of a paddle which will be used to hit the ball from bottom to top in the game. And we have planned to include background music to our game which will be a added feature and will be implemented in coming weeks. As per my analysis, this brick breaker game should need a accurate analysis of each UI component that we implement in the game and the spacings should be maintained very accurately between each component to make the game work.

### **Work Partition and Development Procedure:**
As this game contains many components to implement, we have partitioned this work among the team. And when coming to my part of responsibility for this game developement, I need to design and develop the paddle which is an important part of the game, and also maintain correct dimensions throughout the application for each UI component in the game. And also develop code to make sure each and every 2D object in this game is in its place and change its positions according to the game logic. And to develop code to calculate score for each hit of a brick by the ball and also tracking the count of lives of each player. And the other feature that I have taken as my part is to implement background music to our game. But this feature will be implemented in upcoming sprints.

### **Encountered Roadblocks:**
As this is the first step in developing the project, the main tasks that we focused is to partition the different components among the team members and to analyze the flow of game, components needed to be involved in this game. So, there were no roadblocks for this sprint as most of the coding will be beginning in coming weeks. Needless to say, there were small disaggrements between me and my team members about the game requirements and about some of the functionalities that should be implemented. Apart from this, there were no roadblocks as of now.
