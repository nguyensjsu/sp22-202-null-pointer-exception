## **Overview**<br>
For week4, my main focus was on refactoring the code and implementing the new features that helps the game to enhance more. And also removing any unwanted code or logic implementations from the code to reduce complexity for the game. And also altering the paddle images with small, medium and larger lengths. Because the screen size configurations has been modified. So, I will be explaining the flow and logic that I have implemented and also the design patterns that I have implemented during this week below.
