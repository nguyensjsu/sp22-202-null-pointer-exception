### **Code Implementation and Introduction of New Features:**
For the week 3, I have been totally working on implementing new features into the game and also code refactoring. So, upto now I have implemented the paddle motion and execution of paddle direction to left or right according to the player wish. Now, there is an added feature to this game which I have implemented and that is to show some special bricks in different levels. The main cause of these special bricks is whenever the player hits these special bricks with ball, then a red ball will be released. If the user with the paddle managed to hit the red ball, then the paddle size will be increased to large size.
