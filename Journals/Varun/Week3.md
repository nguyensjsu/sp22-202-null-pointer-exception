### **Code Implementation for New Features:**
For the week 3, I have been totally working on implementing new features into the game and also code refactoring. So, upto now I have implemented the paddle motion and execution of paddle direction to left or right according to the player wish. Now, there is an added feature to this game which I have implemented and that is to show some special bricks in different levels. Before explaining this scenario, I want to elaborate one thing. Basically, in the game we will be having 3 paddle sizes. "Small", "Medium" and "Large". Based on the game rules and player's achievements, the paddle sizes will be increased.By default the paddle size will be "Medium". The main cause of these special bricks is whenever the player hits these special bricks with ball, then a red ball will be released. If the user with the paddle managed to hit the red ball, then the paddle size will be increased to large size.

But there is a small caution in this feature. After getting one redball in the game, if the player again hits a special brick and catches the red ball with paddle, then the paddle size will be changed to small. So, this will surprise any player if he plays this game for the first time. If the player loses his life, then the paddle size will be reset to medium. This is the one new feature that I have implemented during this week. And the next new feature that I have implemented is the sound when the player hits the brick with his ball. And also th implement the sound when the ball touches the paddle. The other feature that I have implemented was the player can select the background color to whatever he needs before playing the game. So, these are the some of the new features that were implemented during this week sprint. I am planning to implement some new features into this application to include some GIFs into the game. If everything goes as per schedule, will finish that in the following week.
