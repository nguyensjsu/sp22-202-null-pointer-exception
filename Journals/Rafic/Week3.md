# Week 3 Journal
<b>Team member: Rafic Roy Hasbini</b>
<br>

<b>What have I been working on?</b>
For this week I have completed several tasks, both administrative and technical.
<br>
Technical tasks:
<br>
1. Contributed to refactoring base code and committed it.
2. Corrected bug with top border collision after refactoring code.
3. Victory was set to when number of bricks. However, when cement bricks are present, Max score is never achieved even if all bricks are destroyed.
So that bug has been fixed now and victory can be achieved when cement bricks are present.
4. Created a Makefile and added it to the
5. Correted a bug for the path of the music file when Makefile was created.
6. Started working on design for bonus level implementation.
<br>
Administrative tasks:
<br>
1. Discussed with team what features the bonus level would have.
2. Updated Kanban board with tasks.

<br>
<br>
<b>What I plan to do today/this week?</b>
<br>
Create design for bonus level ( UML ) and begin implementation. I also plan on developing new features for the bonus level such as player level ups as well as new obsticles.
Update the kanban board and journal entries, as well as take part in the group sprint and design meetings.

<br>
<br>
<b>What are my blockers?</b>
<br>
I do not currently have any blockers. Even though I still need to discuss features with group and recieve approval, I am able to begin design and implemenation of code base.

<br>
<br>
<b>Core XP value - (Simplicity)</b>
<br>
The XP core value of simplicity has been adhered to by setting up standard procedure for the team to follow. I also created the Makefile to create a standard
way to run the code without running into compiling errors. By creating systems we are able to simply follow procedures and move forwrd with our development.
Simplicity is also seen in our code by creating a loosely coupled implementation.
