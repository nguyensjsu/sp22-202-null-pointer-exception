# Week 4 Journal

<b>Team Member: Rafic Roy Hasbini</b>

<b>What have I been working on?</b>
For this week it was essential to complete implementation of the game and prepare for the demo. Initially I was tasked with creating a bonus level.
However upon meeting with the team, it was decided there were more important tasks that could be implemented such as refactoring racket code to implement
a decorator design pattern. I was able to implement the decorator for racket to allow for easier implementation of racket level ups. This was tested and verified
as working. This implementation involved creating the relavent classes and updating the GameBoard.java implementation to take into account updates.
<br>
The bonus level feature was removed and it was decided that a state design pattern could be used to implement a new switch arrow direction feature. I completed this
task by implementing a state machine and added a flag and state variable to compliment the logic. I also completed testing to insure the feature was implemented correctly.
<br>
During implementation, there were several bugs introduced to the code. After testing, I was able to identify the bugs and coordinate fixes with the team. I also
corrected bugs with my implementation of the racket decorator successfully.
<br>
Finally once we decided on code freeze I took part in a comprehensive testing of the code. Features were tested to identify any last minute bugs.
<br>
Administrative tasks included working on the demo video and the pitch video, as well as completing UML diagrams for our code.

<br>
<br>
<b>What I plan to do today/this week?</b>
<br>
This is the final sprint for this project, so there will be no more implementation of new features. However, testing will continue to insure a stable build
for demo. The remaining tasks are mostly administrative and include completing supporting documentation for the project.
<br>
If any bugs show up from testing, they may be addressed.

<br>
<br>
<b>What are my blockers?</b>
<br>
I do not currently have any blockers.

<b>Core XP value - (Simplicity)</b>
<br>
To adhere to the core value of simplicity, the team has been strict to implement only what has been agreed on in each sprint. We frequently took part in discussions
to maintain an updated product backlog. Tasks to be completed were placed on the product backlog to ensure that each developer's time was used to complete what
is essential for completing the project. If any new ideas came up, they were discussed and added to the kanban board.  Simplicity also applied to the code,
where only essential code was implemented to meet required tasks.
